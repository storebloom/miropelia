== Installation ==

Install ShareThis Share Buttons just like any other plugin. Simply download the file directly from this page or search for us in the WordPress directory and click "Install". After you install and activate the plugin, simply configure your buttons and create an account.

If you’re already using the new ShareThis buttons, and want to migrate to our WordPress plugin, we’ve got your back. Install the plugin, then from the first configuration screen click, connect to an existing property. Login, and select your property from the list. We’ll sync your settings from our platform. Don’t forget to remove the hard coded JS, and any hard coded inline share button divs!

By creating an account with ShareThis, you agree to our [terms of use](https://sharethis.com/publisher-terms-of-use/) which includes the ability to keep track of user interactions with our buttons. You can read our privacy policy here: [https://www.sharethis.com/privacy/](https://sharethis.com/privacy/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I reconfigured my buttons on the ShareThis platform, but nothing happened on my site. What’s going on here?**

We cache your ShareThis platform button configurations (social networks, button size, labels etc.) to optimize their performance. Sometimes changes you make on the ShareThis platform take a couple minutes to update on your site. Also, if you activate a new button type from the settings page you may experience a similar lag.
